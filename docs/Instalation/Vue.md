# Vue

Vue.js is a free and open-source front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Getting Started

Run the following command in your command line:

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

This will create a new Vue project called `myapp`. You can now run the project by running the following command:

```bash
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port `3000`. You can now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

### Alternative

You can also use Vite to create a new Vue project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

and then select `vue` as the framework.
