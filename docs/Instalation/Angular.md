# Angular

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

## Getting Started

To get started with Angular, you need to install the Angular CLI. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This will install the Angular CLI globally on your machine. You can now create a new Angular project by running the following command:

```bash
ng new my-app
```

This will create a new Angular project called `my-app`. You can now run the project by running the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
ng serve
```

This will start the development server on port `4200`. You can now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your application running.
