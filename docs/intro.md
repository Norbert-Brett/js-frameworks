# Project Intro

This project a comparison blog for the following frameworks:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

## Why?

My goal is to learn more about these frameworks and to help others learn about them as well. And having everything in the same place will make it easier to navigate. I will be explaining the differences between them and how to get started with each one.
